## Release truth

The accepted V2.2.0 release commit is:

`0e813e5e1360318211e05c1c5fec5eb82be00224`

The annotated release tag is:

`v2.2.0`

Tag object:

`df1acb238838ed814b969e20fe85a49253a92861`

The annotated tag dereferences exactly to the accepted release commit above. The tag is the immutable V2.2.0 release boundary; later documentation-only main commits do not change the tagged release contents.

## W6 accepted release evidence

Exact tested product-code SHA:

`8b10a59496a21a4d34cb95b99d0bd496f82bfd92`

Formal local report:

`docs/validation/LOCAL_VALIDATION_V2_2_W6.md`

Report-only commit:

`b1c55f65bc37990242b215a3d015e8dae91ea835`

Report-only GitHub CI:

`32964002626` / #566 — Ubuntu, Windows, Browser smoke, Windows media smoke all PASS.

Accepted W6 main:

`d629249f9dbc877eadc68ce61f47c16f80a883b1`

W6 proved on real Windows/browser/media/engines:

- Talking Head / 9:16 — PASS;
- Product Ad / 16:9 — PASS;
- Restart Recovery / 1:1 — PASS;
- all 16 Workflow Stages — PASS;
- Content Review / Assembly Review — PASS;
- real video-use transcription — PASS;
- HyperFrames motion — PASS;
- Remotion Final Render — PASS;
- FFmpeg/ffprobe and actual encoded-frame inspection — PASS;
- revision/idempotency/no-duplicate checks — PASS;
- durable reload/reopen and restart recovery — PASS;
- residual-process/lock cleanup — PASS.

No W6 release-blocking product defect remained and no product-code/config/test/schema/pin change was required during formal acceptance.

## V2.2.0 release metadata evidence

`package.json`, the package-lock top-level version, and `packages[""]` are all `2.2.0`.

The package-lock sync commit:

`8bddb2c4a174da98cef9bad760ab93691bc4d0d0`

changed exactly the two Video OS Studio version metadata fields. Local Codex verified `npm ci` and `npm run typecheck` with no additional lockfile drift. Final release-candidate GitHub CI Run #571 passed Ubuntu, Windows, Browser Smoke and Windows Media Smoke before PR #38 was merged.

## Accepted invariants

Project Schema:       2.0.0

```

- Project JSON remains durable editing truth.
- Workflow durable state remains separate from Project Schema.
- Durable Job runtime remains concrete execution truth.
- Workflow Stages use registered services/jobs/transactions and do not directly spawn engines.
- Long-running mutation work preserves Project revision and operation idempotency contracts.

## Post-release boundary

V2.2.0 is closed. Do not make additional V2.2 product changes under the release workstream.

The experimental branch `feature/v2.2-w55-workflow-template` was not part of the accepted V2.2 Master PRD release path and was not merged into V2.2. Re-evaluate it only under a separately approved future scope.

V2.3 Real AI Director / AI Editing Agent has **not started**. Before V2.3 implementation, create and approve a dedicated PRD/workstream and branch from current `main`.
